# StopAll Ads Tests

## Introduction

The `stopalladstests` repository contains the test suite for the StopAll Ads
extension in Firefox. This test suite is itself a separate Firefox extension
which interacts with the StopAll Ads extension in order to test it.

Some of the tests in this test suite are also reused by the Chrome/Opera/Safari
version of StopAll Ads. Please see the `stopalladschrome` repository for
details on how to run the tests there.
